`babycli` is a modern CLI arguments parser for Go.

### Requirements

The minimum Go version is `go1.22`.

### Install

Use `go get` to grab the latest version of `babycli`.

```shell
go get -u noxide.lol/go/babycli@latest
```

### Influence

This library was made after many projects of using [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli),
one of the better command line parser libraries for Go. `babycli` models itself
after this library but with a cleaner, more robust implementation under the hood.
Credit of inspiration belongs to the authors.

### Experimental

(!) Please note this library is still experimental and being worked on, with
breaking changes being very likely.
